## Advent of Code 2022

This probject contains 2 different solutions to every problem. One that does not have a single heap allocation and one that solves it in the most naive way possible.

You can compile and run the project with 
`dotnet run --project src/AdventOfCode/AdventOfCode.csproj -c Release`

Note: make sure you run it in Release mode if you want to check for allocations.
